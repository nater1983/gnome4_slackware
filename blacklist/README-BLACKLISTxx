A) In this folder are core slackaware packages AND their deps. 
All SlackBuilds must following 3 rulles:

1) PKGTYPE=${PKGTYPE:-txz}
2) TMP=${TMP:-./}
3) OUTPUT="$CWD"
This way we dont build anymore in /tmp also package.txz output stored at the same folder and not in /tmp. 
Everything are in one place.   

B) When a package is not needed any more because stock version is ok for Gnome buildings,
we DONT remove it its place to removed folder.Simple cd to its /order and remove .sh extensions from files build order.
EXAMPLE: Assume gtk4 stock is in the correct version for Gnome needs. 
mv  /BLACKLIST46/order/01-build_gtk4.sh /BLACKLIST46/order/01-build_gtk4

Thas all, gtk4 will never be builder again as long as 01-build_gtk4 file not having .sh exetnsion.
