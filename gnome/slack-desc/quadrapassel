# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

quadrapassel: quadrapassel (GNOME Quadrapassel game)
quadrapassel:
quadrapassel: Quadrapassel comes from the classic falling-block game, Tetris. The 
quadrapassel: goal of the game is to create complete horizontal lines of blocks,
quadrapassel: which will disappear. The blocks come in seven different shapes made 
quadrapassel: from four blocks each: one straight, two L-shaped, one square, and
quadrapassel: two S-shaped. The blocks fall from the top center of the screen in
quadrapassel: a random order. You rotate the blocks and move them across the
quadrapassel: screen to drop them in complete lines.
