# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mutter: mutter (GNOME Display Server and Window Manager)
mutter:
mutter: Mutter is a window and compositing manager that displays and manages
mutter: your desktop via OpenGL. Mutter combines a sophisticated display 
mutter: engine using the Clutter toolkit with solid window-management logic
mutter: inherited from the Metacity window manager. While Mutter can be used
mutter: stand-alone, it is primarily intended to be used as the display core
mutter: of a larger system such as GNOME Shell. For this reason, Mutter is
mutter: very extensible via plugins, which are used both to add fancy visual 
mutter: effects and to rework the window management behaviors to meet the
mutter: needs of the environment.
